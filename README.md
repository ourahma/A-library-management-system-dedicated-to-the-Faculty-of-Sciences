# Library Management System for the Faculty of Sciences

This project is a comprehensive library management system designed to simplify and streamline the operations of a university library. It is developed with Django and caters to three key roles: librarians, users, and a higher-level administrator. The system allows for secure authentication, book management, reservation handling, and user communication with librarians.

## Target Audience
